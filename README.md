**Features**

* Dynamic icon dependeing on the weather

**Disclamier**
The coordinates for the city borders around the world were gather from "https://github.com/drei01/geojson-world-cities" as a geojson file
A lot of the cities border seems to be off of what the real border should look like.
You can research on your own for a more accurate geojson file of world cities if you preffer.


*Let me know if you find a more accurate cities geojson file for the borders*
